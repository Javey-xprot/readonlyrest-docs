# List of Elasticsearch actions available in various Elasticsearch versions
We automated the extraction from source code of all the action strings available in major Elasticsearch versions to your convenience when using the "actions" rule in ReadonlyREST ACL.
For more information about the ACL and the actions rule, refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/beshu-tech/readonlyrest-docs/blob/master/elasticsearch.md#actions).
